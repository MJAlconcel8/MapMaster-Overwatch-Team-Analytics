Based on the plot I created, it can be determined that Toronto should practice on is University because that is their lowest winning percentage. The problem with that however is that the Gardens, Garden, Meka base, and other maps etc are close to the percentage of wins on University, that it is difficult to tell whether or not they should focus their attention to the University Map, or somewhere else."
